// Your mission is to implement a data type to represent JSON.
//
// If you know about the built-in collection types such as List and Map it's ok
// to use them as part of your model.
//
// Need some help? At json.org you'll find a "railway diagram" that defines the
// syntax of JSON. If you look past the syntax you'll find the data model is
// described there as well.
//
// If you complete this, and still have time, implement a method called `print`
// that prints your JSON data structure to a `String` as valid (textual) JSON.
